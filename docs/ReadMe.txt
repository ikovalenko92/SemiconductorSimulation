This is a simulation build using the Repast Simphony software (https://repast.github.io/). You must download this software to be able to run the project.

The Resources folder has all of the physical representations of the machines, robots, etc. It also has the graphics for each of those components.

The Agents folder has all of the agents that were used to control the resources in the simulation.

If you have any questions or are unable to run the code, please send an email to me (Ilya Kovalenko) at ikoval@umich.edu.
