release of JMatLink 1.3.0
2005/12/28 stefan changed JMatLink.java changed version id from 1.2.0 to 1.3.0
2005/12/27 stefan added   SimpleTestGui02.java as a simple test utility for
						  engGetFigure()
2005/12/17 stefan changed testEngGetFigure() more tests
						  SimpleTestGui changed x-y of engGetFigure()
						  JMatLink changed x-y of engGetFigure()
2005/12/27 stefan changed JMatLink.java added Image engGetFigure(long epI, int figure, 
                          int dy, int dx)
						  in order to retrieve figures from matlab in the java 
						  environment. Also added a mechanism to remove temporary
						  image-filenames. These images sometimes cannot be deleted
						  immediately. A list keeps track of all not deleted images.
2005/11/10 stefan added   testEngGetCharArray.java to test the engGetCharArray
                          methods.
2005/11/10 stefan added   JMatLink.java engGetCharArray( epI, name). There 
						  was only the function without engine pointer 
						  engGetCharArray(name)
2005/11/08 stefan fixed   Benchmark01.java and EnduranceTest01.java StressTest.java
2005/11/06 stefan changed SimpleTestGui.java added support for getFigure()
2005/11/06 stefan changed JMatLink.java and added a method 
                          Image engGetFigure(int figure, int dy, int dx)
                          in order to return an image of a Matlab figure

release of JMatLink 1.2.0
2005/11/02 stefan changed JMatLink.java added more comments
2005/11/02 stefan changed CoreJMatLink.java removed engGetCharArray from file,
                          function is still available in JMatLink.java
2005/10/30 stefan changed build.xml and added task to compile c-file to dll
2005/10/29 stefan changed CoreJMatLink.java added more useful text if loading of
                          the library failed.
2005/10/27 stefan changed CoreJMatLink.java added mechanism to stop and start the
                          engine thread. If no connection to matlab is active the
                          engine thread is terminated. Upon opening a new connection
                          the thread is started again.
2005/10/27 stefan changed JMatLink.java see above
2005/10/27 stefan changed SimpleTestGui.java and added button to toggle debug output
2005/10/27 stefan added   build.properties build.xml as ant scripts in order to
                          generate a release very quickly
2005/10/23 stefan changed SimpleTestGui.java JMatLink.java removed kill()
2005/10/23 stefan changed SimpleTestGui.java added button for debug info
2005/10/23 stefan changed CoreJMatLink.java added code to kill and restart the JMatLink thread.
                          After closing all engines it is not necessary to call kill() on 
                          JMatLink any more.
2005/10/15 stefan added   HowToMakeARelease.txt
2005/10/08 stefan changed some return values in JMatLink.c from "NULL" to "0"

release of JMatLink 1.1.0
2005/07/10 stefan fixed   some problems with engOpen, engClose, engOutputBuffer

                          engClose()
2005/07/07 stefan changed CoreJMatLink.java JMatLink.c JMatLink.java SimpleTestGui.java
                          and implemented first working versin of different output buffers.
                          New behavior of engOutputBuffer(ep, len) and
                          engGetOutputBuffer(ep)
2005/06/26 stefan changed CoreJMatLink.java to support original engGetVariable() and
                          engPutVariable() methods
2005/06/26 stefan added   EnduranceTest01.java to test the engine interface over
                          a long period of time (>1hour). I already found a memory
                          leak with this new program.
2005/06/26 stefan fixed   JMatLink.c memory leak in engPutVariableNATIVE added
                          ReleaseDoubleArrayElements() to release memory

2005/06/26 stefan fixed   some issues for engOutputBuffer()
2005/06/19 stefan added   methods engSetVisible() and engGetVisible(). This makes the
                          MATLAB window on a Windows-Desktop visible/invisible. It 
                          also returns a status of visibility.
2005/06/19 stefan changed testsuite/AllTests.java testJMatLink.java
2005/06/19 stefan added   support for exceptions to JMatLink (JMatLinkException.java) and
                          removed a couple of methods which are not core-functions in
                          CoreJMatLink.java. The functions must be created in JMatLink.java
2005/06/19 stefan added   testcases testEngClose.java for testing of engClose(...)
2005/06/19 stefan added   testcases testEngOpen.java for testing of engOpen(...)
2005/06/19 stefan added   testcases testEngEvalString.java for testing of engEvalString(...)
2005/06/14 stefan added   Benchmark01.java new benchmark suite to test the power 
                          and speed of JMatLink
2005/06/12 stefan added   testSingleUse for tests of engOpenSingleUse. Testing the
                          connection to two running instances of MATLAB in parallel
2005/06/12 stefan changed JMatLink.c JMatLink.h JMatLink.java CoreJMatLink.java
                          SimpleTestGui.java StressTest01.java and introduced
                          a pointer system. Now the engine functions return a
                          "long" value which is casted from the (Engine *) pointer.
                          This allows to call directly to different engines
2005/06/12 stefan changed JMatLink.c and added more comments
2005/06/11 stefan changed SimpleTestGui.java changed if-if-if into if-else if-else if
2005/06/11 stefan added   SimpleTextGUI02.java : sends commands from the prompt to 
                          MATLAB and returns the corresponding outputbuffer
2005/06/11 stefan added   SimpleTextGUI01.java : sends one command to MATLAB and returns outputbuffer
2005/06/07 stefan changed JMatLink.java cleanup of code and comments
2005/06/06 stefan bugfix  JMatLink.java minor corrections due to new class CoreJMatLink.java
2005/06/05 stefan changed JMatLink.h .java .c to work with the new CoreJMatLink.java file
2005/06/05 stefan added   a new class called CoreJMatLink.java which will do all communication
                          with Matlab. I'm planning to receive more different types of arrays
                          from the workspace. double, int, boolean.
2005/05/28 stefan changed testJMatLink.java and removed functions setUp and tearDown, 
                          which are called by JUnit before and after each test. Since
                          opening and closing the engine interface has to be tested 
                          in many ways, it is done now inside each testcase.
2005/05/26 stefan changed JMatLink.h JMatLink.c JMatLink.java changed to new methods
                          engPutVariable() and engGetVariable() of matlab
2005/05/25 stefan added   src/jmatlink/testsuite/StressTest01.java for stress testing
                          of the engine functions. high volume of same tests
